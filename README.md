## About The Project

Concurrency testing often poses challenges due to the non-deterministic nature of threads and synchronization mechanisms. The DeterministicConcurrency library aims to address these challenges by providing tools to create and manage deterministic concurrency scenarios, enabling precise and reliable testing.<br />
While primarily designed for testing, the User-Controlled Scheduler can also serve as a framework to create synchronized thread pool-like structures for broader multithread applications.

## Getting Started

This is an header only library but you can build the main.cpp which contains a simple test using:

   ```sh
   cmake . -B build -DDC_COMPILE_MAIN=ON -G Ninja
   ```

   ```sh
   cmake --build build
   ```

You can also generate the build files to build the tests with:
   ```sh
   cmake . -B build -DDC_COMPILE_TESTS=ON -G Ninja
   ```


### Prerequisites

I build and tested this lib with C++17.
If for some reason, on some compilers, it doesn`t work on C++17+ please email me or open an issue.

### Installation

Using cmake you can include this lib using:
```
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
  dc
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/Sernior/deterministic-concurrency.git
  GIT_TAG [TAG] #change with the tag you want to use
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(dc)
```

At this point you should be able to link the library simply using:
```
target_link_libraries(your_stuff.cpp deterministic_concurrency)
```

## Usage

Include the library:
```
#include <DeterministicConcurrency>
```
Define the functions you want the threads to execute:
```
void f(DeterministicConcurrency::thread_context* c ,int a, int b){
    std::cout << a;
    c->switchContext(); // wait until the scheduler switch context to this thread
    std::cout << b;
}

void h(DeterministicConcurrency::thread_context* c ,int a, int b){
    std::cout << b;
    c->switchContext();
    std::cout << a;
}
```
The first parameter must always be a pointer to DeterministicConcurrency::thread_context.<br /><br />
Now define your user controlled scheduler:
```
DeterministicConcurrency::UserControlledScheduler<2> sch{std::tuple{&f, 0, 1}, std::tuple{&h, 3, 2}};
```
This defines a scheduler which control 2 threads.<br />
The elements in the tuple after &f and &h are the arguments that will be passed to **`f`** and **`h`**.<br />
These threads will wait until they have been given permission from the scheduler to execute **`f`** and **`h`** (using switchContextTo).<br />
**`UserControlledScheduler::switchContextTo(threadIndexes...)`** and **`thread_context::switchContext()`** will block the caller thread until the context is given back.<br />
What threads are within the **`UserControlledScheduler`** is elements in a std::array; you can think their indexes as their threadIDs.<br /><br />
For instance in this example you can do:
```
sch.switchContextTo(1);
sch.switchContextTo(0);
sch.switchContextTo(0);
sch.switchContextTo(1);
```
And you will end up printing "2013".<br /><br />
The "main" thread (the one which defines the scheduler) and the threads synchronize through a system of tick() and tock() (my own definition of time).<br />
The scheduler can switch context to a specific thread **`sch.switchContextTo(1)`** allowing it to continue (you could also switch context to multiple threads to simulate real parallelism **`sch.switchContextTo(0,1)`**); and it can also use **`sch.joinOn(indexes...)`** to wait until threads finish.<br />
